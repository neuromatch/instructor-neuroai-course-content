    "This paper by Wang et al. (2018) aims to reconciliate the theory of dopamine based-learning in the striatum with findings that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) show activations related to actions, states and rewards. The paper presents a theory proposing that the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) along with the basal ganglia can be modeled as a recurrent neural network that functions akin to a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) system. Dopamine based learning allows the weights of the model PFC to change to allow it to learn a second RL algorithm dynamically, as the properties of the environment changes. The new algorithm is implemented by the activations of the PFC, and is independent of the original training task. This allows the PFC to adapt to new situations using prior learning experiences, essentially learning to learn.\n",

    "We will explore here the demo that the authors showcase in their Figure 1, which shows that after training a recurrent neural network that serves as a PFC model on different contexts, the resulting network is a full-fledged RL procedure. We see how the trained network adapts to the fast changing latent world state, and how it behaves likes an RL algorithm (e.g., how it performs an exploration-exploitation tradeoff)."

    "### Task\n",
    "The task is a two-armed bandit task, where the agent choses one of the arms (left or right), and each arm has a probability of yielding a reward (the probabilities add up to 1). Each episode consists of 100 trials, and at the end of the episode, the probabilities change, and the agent needs to learn the new probabilities to know which arm to choose. In the framework we discussed in the lecture, the change of the probabilities corresponds to the fast latent world state. Further, the RL agents are trained in two contexts (slow): one in which the probilities of the consecutive episodes are uncorrelated, and one in which they are correlated.\n"

    "The transition from exploration to exploitation occurs more slowly in more difficult problems, as indicated in the provided figure (part c). In episodes with reward parameters such as 0.6 and 0.4, where the difference in reward probability between actions is smaller, it's tougher for the agent to ascertain which action is better. Hence, more exploration is needed before a confident shift to exploitation can occur.\n",
